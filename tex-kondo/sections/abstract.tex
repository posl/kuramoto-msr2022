\begin{abstract}
Issue reports are a pivotal interface between developers and users to receive the information about bugs present in their products. In practice, issue reports often have incorrect or insufficient information to reproduce bugs, which delays the whole bug-fixing process. 
To facilitate their bug-reproduction work, GitHub has provided a new feature to share movies (i.e., mp4 files). Using movies, reporters can notify of the details of bugs by visualizing the symptoms, reproduction steps, and other kinds of important information. 

While such visualized issue reports (\textit{visual issue reports}) have the potential to significantly improve the bug-fixing process, no studies have empirically examined the impact on the bug-fixing process. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary study to reveal the characteristics of visual issue reports by comparing them with non-visual issue reports.  

We collect 3,819 movies and 33,079 images from 711,160 issues on 4,173 publicly available repositories. Contrary to our hypothesis, our preliminary analysis shows that the visual issue reports need a longer time to be resolved. In addition, we observed that their discussions with visual issue reports contain many topics about conditions for reproduction (e.g., when) and GUI (e.g., dropdown). 

%In addition, to promote the research about visual issue reports,  we provide a dataset of visual issue reports.
