In distributed development, asynchronous communication 
across developers is an essential part. 
To promote asynchronous communication across developers, 
GitHub has recently released a new feature to share movies on GitHub. 
This feature has the potential to make asynchronous communication 
across developers quickly. 
However, no database or studies about this topic exist so far. 
In this paper, we present the first database that 
consists of movies and images in publicly available repositories on GitHub. 
Specifically, we collected 3,819 videos and 33,079 images 
from 711,160 issues on 4,173 publicly available repositories.
