In distributed development, asynchronous communication 
across developers is an essential part. 
To promote such communication, 
GitHub has recently released a new feature to share movies on GitHub. 
This feature can visualize various contents users want to share on GitHub. 
Such visualization can support questioner and questionee because 
it is easy to share and understand the contents such as reporting bugs and 
clarifying the way to reproduce the bugs.
% Using visualization is a typical solution to 
% % improve the understandability of the contents 
% support questioner and questionee
% in software development such as showing demos. 
Hence, this feature has the potential to make asynchronous communication 
across developers quickly. 
However, no database or studies about the impact of
the visualization on GitHub exist so far. 
In this paper, we present the first database that 
consists of movies and images in publicly available 
repositories on GitHub and show the result of the initial analysis. 
Specifically, we collected 3,819 movies and 33,079 images 
from 711,160 issues on 4,173 publicly available repositories.
Our initial analysis revealed that the issues with either 
images or movies need a longer time to be resolved and 
are related to the topics of visualization and GUI.
