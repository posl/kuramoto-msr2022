In distributed development, asynchronous communication 
across developers is an essential part. 
To promote asynchronous communication across developers, 
GitHub has recently released a new feature to share movies on GitHub. 
This feature has the potential to make asynchronous communication 
across developers quickly. 
However, no database or studies about this topic exist so far. 
In this paper, we present the first database that 
consists of movies and images in publicly available repositories on GitHub. 
Specifically, we collected \masa{number} videos and \masa{number} images 
from \masa{number} issues on \masa{number} publicly available repositories.
