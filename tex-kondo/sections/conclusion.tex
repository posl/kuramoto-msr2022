\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we conducted a preliminary study to reveal  
whether visual issue reports help developers or not. 
Our study demonstrated that visual issue reports still 
require developers to write as many words as non-visual issue reports, 
and need a longer time to be resolved. 
%In addition, we listed the future research directions and presented a dataset of visual issue reports.
