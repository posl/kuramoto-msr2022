\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we conducted a preliminary study to reveal  
whether visual issue reports help developers or not. 
% Our study demonstrated that visual issue reports still 
% require developers to write as many words as non-visual issue reports, 
% and need a longer time to be resolved. 
% Our study demonstrated that visual issue reports are likely to reduce amounts of texts to describe bugs and do not affect their resolution times. 
Our study demonstrated that issue reports with images are described in fewer words and do not affect their resolution times. 
%In addition, we listed the future research directions and presented a dataset of visual issue reports.
