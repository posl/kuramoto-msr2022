% In this paper, we present a dataset, 
% which consists of issues with images and movies 
% in GitHub and show the results of our initial analysis. 
% This dataset represents the number of images and movies 
% for each issue, 
% the issue resolution time, 
% the number of comments, 
% the time until the first comment is submitted, 
% the number of characters in the description, 
% and the TFIDF of words in the descriptions. 
% % We show that the statistics of the dataset and 
% % implied that the images and movies may affect 
% % the issue resolution time. 
% This dataset is a first step to investigate 
% the impact of images and movies on communication in GitHub. 
% In addition, our initial analysis shows that images and movies 
% are used in issues that need a longer time to be resolved and 
% are related to the topics of visualization and GUI. 
% Hence, future studies are necessary to deeply look at 
% the impact of images and movies to accelerate communication 
% in GitHub.

In this paper, we conducted a preliminary study of 
whether visual issue reports help developers or not. 
Our study revealed that even such issue reports still 
require developers to write words as much as non-visual issue reports 
and need a longer time to be resolved. 
In addition, we listed the future research directions and 
presented a dataset of visual issue reports.
