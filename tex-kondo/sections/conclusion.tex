Finally, we present future research directions with our dataset. 


\noindent
\textbf{The impact analysis of movies and images on software development.}
GitHub added the feature~\citep{github-video-blog} to easily 
share movies with GitHub to earn advantages 
in software development such as reproducing bugs easily in issues and 
explaining the background of changes in pull requests. 
However, no studies exist that investigate whether such movies 
impact software development. 
Hence, investigating the impact of movies on software development 
is a future research direction. 
Specifically, we study the reduction of issue resolution time, 
the response rate of developers, and 
the reduction of the number of comments 
in which developers write ``works for me''.
