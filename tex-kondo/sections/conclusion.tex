\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we conducted a preliminary study of 
whether visual issue reports help developers or not. 
Our study revealed that even such issue reports still 
require developers to write words as much as non-visual issue reports 
and need a longer time to be resolved. 
In addition, we listed the future research directions and 
presented a dataset of visual issue reports.
