\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

In this section, we describe the data collection process and 
the overview of the collected dataset. 

\subsection{Data Collection}
We collected the data from the issues of 
the publicly available repositories on GitHub. 
We first select the repositories based on the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the number of stars $\geq$ 10
	\item the number of issues $\geq$ 1
	\item the latest commit\masa{or the latest issue?} is in 2021
\end{itemize}
We used the number of stars for retrieving the repositories 
in which the owner may communicate with other developers and 
discard repositories developed by only the owner. 
In addition, we used the date of the latest commit 
because the major release of the feature is in 2021. 
Beforehand, the feature was the beta version.
