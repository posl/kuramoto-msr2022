\subsection{Why Do Issue Reports with Videos or Images Take a Longer Time than Others?}
To clarify the topics, we computed the TFIDF values 
on $Words$ for each category. 
The TFIDF values clarify the differences in the appearances of 
words between visual issue reports and 
non-visual issue reports. 
\textbf{The visual issue reports and the issues 
reports with images have more words 
about visualization or GUI.}
\tab{tab:tfidf-result} shows the top-10 TFIDF words
% in $Words$ 
for each category.
It should be noted that we remove a kind of stop words such as 
``at'', ``it'', and ``the''. 
% extracted from our dataset. 
We observed words related to visualization such as 
``image'' and ``view'' in the $Img$ and $Mov$ categories. 
Also, we observed words related to GUI such as 
``dropdown'' and ``button'' in the $Mov$ category. 
The word ``when'' indicates high TFIDF values 
in the $Img$ and $Mov$ categories. 
Our manual analysis reveals that the issues with 
these words relate to reporting bugs. 
Hence, the issues in these two categories are 
probably more related to reporting bugs.
