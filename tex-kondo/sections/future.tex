\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

We currently plan to further improve our dataset. 
In this section, we describe ideas to improve the dataset. 
First, we intend to remove the bot comments as much as 
possible. 
Almost all OSSs use bots to promote software development 
such as automatically closing the abandoned issues with 
a comment. 
However, such bots may change the characteristics of 
the dataset. 
Hence, we should remove such comments. 
Also, we want to classify the data based on 
the characteristics of the repositories. 
Currently, we collected all repositories. 
However, the repositories have their characteristics. 
A repository is a web framework while another repository is 
a machine learning library. 
In addition, the development state of repositories is different. 
The characteristics of the repositories in which 
developers start to develop and the repositories that 
have already released many major versions should be different. 
Finally, we intend to improve the script and 
collect all repositories that meet the condition we described in \sec{sec:dataset}.
