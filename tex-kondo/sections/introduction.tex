\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In recent years, distributed development~\citep{sengupta2006ICSE} 
such as remote work has become more important 
than in the last decades~\citep{ford2021TOSEM}. 
Indeed, developers in industry also employ remote work
in recent years~\citep{gitlab2020survey}.
% for work-life balance. 
To make distributed development successful, 
developers have to be aware of their communication 
in their communities. 
% For example, developers for open source software develop software
% at different times and in different regions, while
For example, developers for open source software are 
distributed around the world and live in different time zones, 
while developers in the same company generally gather around 
the office and live in the same time zone. 
GitLab Inc. in which all developers work remotely 
public their knowledge of the key steps 
to make remote work successful~\citep{gitlab2020remoteplaybook}. 


However, in general, distributed development still has 
the challenge in communication~\citep{ford2021TOSEM}. 
% \masa{ford's work is a good reference}
For example, in non-distributed development, 
developers would discuss a bug by showing the display of 
their laptop face-to-face. 
The questioner would easily share the way to reproduce the bug 
and the questionee could understand the details of the bug. 
On the contrary, in distributed development such as 
open source software, they have to discuss the bug 
in asynchronous communication 
such as text using issue tracking systems. 
In addition, it is generally difficult to explain the way 
to reproduce the bug in text communication 
even if it is easy to explain the bug by showing 
the display of their laptop. 
Hence, it would take a long time to fix the bug 
in distributed development. 


To address this challenge, GitHub released a new feature 
to easily share movies in May 2021~\citep{github-video-blog}. 
Developers can share their movies such as the mp4 format 
on GitHub (\eg,  issues, pull requests, and discussions). 
For example, developers can share the way to reproduce bugs 
with the screen capture and the questionee can understand 
the bugs quickly even in asynchronous communication. 
% In addition, developers can share the background and 
% the importance of the complex changes easier with 
% only asynchronous communication. 


Asynchronous communication with 
%movies 
such visualization
has the potential 
to promote distributed development. 
Indeed, developers can use this feature to make communication 
in open source software development accelerate. 
However, no studies about asynchronous communication with 
the visualization in software development exist.
% as this feature is new. 
% Hence, it is important to prepare the dataset of the visualization
% for software development. 
Hence, it is important to prepare the dataset of the visualization 
and study it to reveal the impact of the visualization.



% We present a dataset. 
In this paper, we present the first dataset to accelerate 
the research about the impact of visualization 
in communication in GitHub and the initial analysis. 
This dataset consists of movies and images 
in publicly available repositories in GitHub. 
Specifically, we collected 
3,819 movies and 
33,079 images from 
711,160 issues on
4,173 publicly available repositories.

Our initial analysis reveals that 
1) the images and movies are still not popular 
in the issues, while the number of issues with images 
and movies slightly increases in recent years, 
2) the issues with either images or movies need 
a longer time to be resolved than the issues without them, and 
3) the issues with either images or movies are more related to 
the topics of visualization and GUI. 
The main contribution of this paper is 
opening a new research perspective to utilize visualization 
in asynchronous communication and 
preparing a new dataset for this research.
