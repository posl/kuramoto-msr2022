\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In recent years, distributed development~\citep{sengupta2006ICSE} 
has become more important than in the last decades. 
Developers for open source software develop it 
at different times and in different regions. 
Developers in industry employ remote work for work-life balance. 
To make distributed development successful, 
developers have to be aware of their communication 
in their communities. 
Indeed, GitLab Inc. in which all developers work remotely 
public their knowledge of the key steps 
to make remote work successful~\citep{gitlab2020remoteplaybook}. 


However, in general, distributed development still has 
the challenge in communication. 
For example, in non-distributed development, 
developers would discuss a bug by showing the display of 
their laptop face-to-face. 
The questioner would easily share the way to reproduce the bug 
and the questionee could understand the details of the bug. 
On the contrary, in distributed development such as 
open source software, they have to discuss the bug 
in asynchronous communication 
such as text using issue tracking systems. 
In addition, it is generally difficult to explain the way 
to reproduce the bug in text communication 
even if it is easy to explain the bug by showing 
the display of their laptop. 
Hence, it would take a long time to fix the bug 
in distributed development. 


To address this challenge, GitHub released a new feature 
to easily share movies in May 2021~\citep{github-video-blog}. 
Developers can share their movies such as the mp4 format 
on GitHub (\eg,  issues, pull requests, and discussions). 
For example, developers can share the way to reproduce bugs 
with the screen capture and the questionee can understand 
the bugs quickly even in asynchronous communication. 
In addition, developers can share the background and 
the importance of the complex changes easier with 
only asynchronous communication. 


Asynchronous communication with movies has the potential 
to promote distributed development. 
Indeed, developers use this feature to make communication 
in open source software development accelerate. 
However, no studies about asynchronous communication with 
movies in software development exist 
as this feature is new. 
Hence, it is important to prepare the dataset of movies
for software development. 


We present a dataset. 
This dataset consists of movies and images 
in publicly available repositories on GitHub. 
Specifically, we collected 
3,819 movies and 
33,079 images from 
711,160 issues on
4,173 publicly available repositories.
