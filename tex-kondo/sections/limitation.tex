\section{Limitation}
\label{sec:limitation}

As described in \sec{sec:dataset}, we randomly selected 
repositories because of the limitation of execution time. 
The proportion of studied repositories is less than 2\%. 
However, the number of resolved issues that 
we collected is 770,656. 
Hence, the number of resolved issues is enough. 

GitHub has released the feature in May 2021. 
Hence, this feature is still new. 
\fig{fig:data-cat-trend} shows that the number of 
issues that have movies has slightly increased so far; 
therefore, we can extend the dataset in the future. 
This extension may change the characteristics of 
the results based on the current dataset.
