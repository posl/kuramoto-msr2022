\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:limitation}

While the number of issue reports that we studied is 770,656,  this number accounts for only less than 2\% of all the repository due to the time limitation. 
We believe that the selection of repositories is not biased because we randomly selected these repositories. 
Still, we cannot generalizerize the findings in this study. 

In addition, since GitHub released the feature to post videos in May 2021, this feature is still new and yet to be common. The number of visual issue reports has increased as \fig{fig:data-cat-trend} shows, and then the results may vary after the feature becomes popular. 

We collected the issue reports with PyGitHub. 
However, in this process, some pull requests were also collected due to the specification of GitHub. 
Hence, our analysis may include such pull requests as issue reports. \kashiwa{RECHECK}
