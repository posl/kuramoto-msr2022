\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:limitation}

While the number of issue reports that we studied is 770,656,  this number accounts for only less than 2\% of all the repository due to the time limitation. 
We believe that the selection of repositories is not biased because we randomly selected these repositories. 
Still, we cannot generalizerize the findings in this study. 

GitHub has released the feature in May 2021. 
Hence, this feature is still new and not many people know. \fig{fig:data-cat-trend} shows that the number of issue reports that have videos has slightly increased so far.
We need to revise the results when this feature becomes more popular. 

We collected the issue reports with PyGitHub. 
However, in this process, some pull requests were also collected due to the specification of GitHub. 
Hence, our analysis may include such pull requests as issue reports. \kashiwa{RECHECK}
