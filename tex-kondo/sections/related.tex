While numerous studies have studied bug resolution time~\citep{DBLP:conf/msr/ChenNSH14}\citep{DBLP:journals/jss/GarciaSN18}\citep{DBLP:conf/sigsoft/JeongKZ09}\\
\citep{DBLP:conf/icsm/KashiwaYKO14}\citep{DBLP:conf/msr/ZamanAH11}, 
in particular, the following studies investigated the relationship between bug resolution time and various elements of bug reports instead of videos~\citep{DBLP:conf/msr/BhattacharyaN11}\citep{DBLP:conf/csmr/BhattacharyaUNK13}\citep{DBLP:journals/ieicetd/NoyoriWFKONT21}. 
Noyori~\et~\citep{DBLP:journals/ieicetd/NoyoriWFKONT21} investigated the relationship between resolution time and topics included in the comments of issue reports. 
They found that bugs are resolved fast when discussions about symptoms are not needed.  Bhattacharya \et \citep{DBLP:conf/msr/BhattacharyaN11} developed bug-fix
time prediction models using various metrics. They showed that the levels of bug severity and the number of attachments (patches) do not correlate well with bug-fix time. In addition, their later work by Bhattacharya \et~\citep{DBLP:conf/csmr/BhattacharyaUNK13} compared bug-fix time for high-quality and poor quality bug reports. They observed that the text length of descriptions is relatively correlated with bug resolution time. 

Also, several studies utilize visual issue reports for improving bug-fixing process~\citep{DBLP:conf/icse/CooperBCMP21}\citep{TODO}. Cooper~\et~\citep{DBLP:conf/icse/CooperBCMP21} used videos and texts included in issue reports to detect duplicate issue reports.
