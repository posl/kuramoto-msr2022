% 初期段階の調査として，画像及び動画がissueの各attributesに
% 与える影響について調査する．
% 表2で得られたそれぞれのカテゴリ間で比較を比較を行う．
% 等分散性を仮定できないデータが含まれていたため，
% 比較にはSteel-Dwass testを採用する．
% 
% visualizationは，issueの解決時間，
% コメント数，文字数に何らかの影響を与える．
% 検定結果を表6に示す．
% 有意水準は0.05を採用する．
% IssueResolvedTimeにおいて，
% ImgとMovは片側検定で有意差があった．
% また，表Xより，平均値，中央値でNoneカテゴリの
% issueよりImgとMovカテゴリのissueの方が
% 課題解決時間が長かった．
% よって，画像もしくは動画がissue作成時に付与
% される課題はその解決時間が有意に長くなる．
% また，#comments及び#charsでは両側検定で
% 有意であり，これらのattributesにも
% 有意な影響を与えることがわかった．
