\subsection{Data Description}
\input{tables/issue-category}
We classified the collected issue reports into three categories based on whether they have images and movies. \tab{tab:issue-category} shows the number of issue reports for each category. 
Note that issue reports often have both images and movies. 
These issue reports are counted in both $Img$ and $Mov$ categories (only X\%). 
Thus, the total number of downloaded issue reports is different from the sum of \#issues in \masa{Table X}\masa{Kashiwa-sensei wrote this right? I highlight the unknown table number->Yes}. 
In this paper, we refer to the issue reports in the $Mov$ category 
as \textit{visual issue reports}. 

\input{figures/data-category-trend}
We collected XXX videos and XXX images from XXX issue reports. Out of the collected issues, only 4.65\% of issue reports have images, and 0.54\% have videos. While this number seems to be small, looking into the trend shown in \fig{fig:data-cat-trend}, the rate of visual issue reports by year is increasing from 2017 to 2020. The ratio of visual issue reports reached to 5\% between 2018 and 2021.

% 初期段階の調査として，画像及び動画がissueの各attributesに
% 与える影響について調査する．
% 表2で得られたそれぞれのカテゴリ間で比較を比較を行う．
% 等分散性を仮定できないデータが含まれていたため，
% 比較にはSteel-Dwass testを採用する．
% 
% visualizationは，issueの解決時間，
% コメント数，文字数に何らかの影響を与える．
% 検定結果を表6に示す．
% 有意水準は0.05を採用する．
% IssueResolvedTimeにおいて，
% ImgとMovは片側検定で有意差があった．
% また，表Xより，平均値，中央値でNoneカテゴリの
% issueよりImgとMovカテゴリのissueの方が
% 課題解決時間が長かった．
% よって，画像もしくは動画がissue作成時に付与
% される課題はその解決時間が有意に長くなる．
% また，#comments及び#charsでは両側検定で
% 有意であり，これらのattributesにも
% 有意な影響を与えることがわかった．
% ただし，imageとmovieに有意差は

\fig{fig:words} shows the distributions in the number of words 
written in descriptions of issue reports. 
%The green line in the box shows the median, 
%the bottom and the top lines of the box show 25 and 75 percentile, respectively. 
The median of DescriptionLength was 36 words in Img, 
46 in Vid, and 36 in None. 
The number of words in videos is slightly larger than 
the others but no statistically significant differences are observed. 
This implies that reporters write as many texts as the others 
to describe the contents of videos.

Contrary to our hypothesis, \fig{fig:resolvedtime} and our observation show that 
the mean and the median $IssueResolvedTime$ values of 
the issue reports in the $Img$ category and the $Vid$ category are 
longer than those in the $None$ category. 
Also, we observed that the issues in the $Img$ category and 
the $Vid$ category are significantly different from those 
in the $None$ category in terms of $IssueResolvedTime$.
