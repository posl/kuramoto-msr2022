\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:rqs}

To clarify the characteristics of 
the issues with images and movies, 
we executed an initial analysis 
in our dataset. 
Specifically, we addressed the following 
two research questions. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[RQ1:] \textbf{\RQone{}}\\
	The feature to share movies on GitHub 
	is still new. 
	Hence, we suppose that using visualization 
	is not popular for developers. 
	In this RQ, we counted the number of 
	issues that use either issues or movies 
	to clarify whether using visualization 
	is popular. 
	\item[RQ2:] \textbf{\RQtwo{}}\\
	We suppose that developers use visualization 
	in particular issues. 
	For example, developers may use visualization 
	to share the way to reproduce bugs. 
	In this RQ, we clarify the differences 
	between the issues with and without 
	visualization. 
\end{itemize}
